# Voice-Assisted Application Form Entry System

## Overview 
This repository houses the codebase and documentation for the Voice-Assisted Application Form Entry System, a solution that leverages technologies such as OCR, NLP, and voice recognition to transform the traditional form-filling experience. The system is designed to enhance the efficiency and accessibility of application form completion by extracting text from scanned forms and utilizing voice-guided interaction for user responses.

## Why This Project?
User-Friendly Experience: By implementing a Voice Assistant, the project ensures an intuitive and user-friendly form-filling experience, making it accessible to a wider audience.

Disruptive Strategy for Form Completion: The combination of OCR and STT technologies offers a novel and disruptive approach, streamlining the form completion process with real-time, accurate data entry.

Critical Industry Applications: Tailored for sectors like healthcare, finance, and legal services, the project's robust data processing and recognition features make it ideal for industries where precision is crucial.

## Methodology
The proposed methodology involves users scanning a physical application form using a mobile app, initiating Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for text extraction. A voice assistant then interacts with users, converting extracted questions to speech and utilizing Speech-to-Text (STT) for recording verbal responses. In real-time, the system populates the application form with user answers. Upon completion, users can choose to print a hardcopy or save the form digitally in formats like PDF or Word. This seamless process integrates OCR and STT, making form-filling efficient and user-friendly.
